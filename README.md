I want the website to have a similar look to the official HBO schedule webpage or the official Cinemax webpage, you'll can take a look with the links below:
https://www.hbo.com/schedule
https://www.cinemax.com/schedule
So I want one channel per line with the logo on the left, and then the different programs shown in cases/rectangles. I also need just like the HBO website for example the ability to change the day, and I want to be able to see all the 24 hours of schedule per day. I also need a vertical line that shows the current time so that we can understand where we are and what's on tv now. Again, try to recreate the same look as the HBO or the Cinemax websites I have gave you the links to before.

I want you to create a fully functionnal website with real data, real programs, and so to recover the data, the API I want you to use are the ones from TV Insider. This way it'll be a lot easier for you to recover all the data from the different channels since you won't have to deal and handle the date from one website and then from another website that's different. With TV Insider you'll be able to recover the data for every channel I want, they're all on this website. So let me give you an example with the schedule of the TNT channel on TV Insider:
https://www.tvinsider.com/network/tnt/schedule/

And it's the same for every other channel, you'll just have to replace the name of the channel in the link by the channel you want. Here are some more example for you to understand how it works with channels that have names with spaces and stuff:

https://www.tvinsider.com/network/5-star-max/schedule/
https://www.tvinsider.com/network/hbo-family/schedule/
https://www.tvinsider.com/network/starz-kids-family/schedule/
https://www.tvinsider.com/network/heroes-icons/schedule/
https://www.tvinsider.com/network/mgm-plus/schedule/

When we click on a program case I want it to open a new tab in the browser with this link:
https://www.google.com/search?q=

And right after the = the title of the program from the case we clicked on.

And in the program cases/rectangles I just need:
-If it's a movie or a series
-The title of the show
-The genre and the year of release
-The time it starts and the duration

I live in New York so for every channel I want the Eastern American schedule, since we're American we'll stick to the USA's regional format with AM/PM, 12-hours format and stuff.
